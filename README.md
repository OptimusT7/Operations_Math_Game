# OPERATIONS MATH GAME!

A fun little game involving math operations!

The game is played by showing the player one number, and then three other numbers which are the result of the first number being put in a random math operation with another number. Can you figure out what the second number is?

Each round gets harder as it goes along - if you really want a challenge, try to get a streak of 100 :)
